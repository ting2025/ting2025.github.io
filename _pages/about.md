About me
======
I'm currently a senior student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, studying a Bachelor of Engineering majoring in Chemical Engineering with an extended major in Artificial Intelligence. I participated in projects for chemical information extraction, specifically in object recognition in chemical reaction mechanisms.

I'm joining the University of Notre Dame as a PhD student in Chemical Engineering. I look forward for research opportunities in AI4Science or the integration of artificial intelligence and chemical engineering.
